# Smart contract for Landing Token project

`LANDC` is a cryptocurrency that aims to revolutionize how people invest in real estate and how people use cryptocurrencies. So far, businesses have few incentives to accept payment in cryptocurrencies. We intend to create a network that will give companies a reason to accept cryptocurrencies and revolutionize how people invest in commercial real estate.
